# java-lexical-analysis-for-loops
 A Java utility that checks the syntax of FOR loop statements in input lines. It reads input from a file, and for each line, it uses regular expressions to determine if the line is a valid FOR loop statement. The program outputs the result of the check, along with the tokens extracted from the line.
